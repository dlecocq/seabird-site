<h2>Inexpensive Custom Branding Iron <small>10 Jan 2014</small></h2>

<div class="post">
    <p>For a while now I&#39;ve been wanting to be able to apply a craftsman signature to
some of my pieces, but custom branding irons can be pretty expensive. Some
people go the route of starting with a piece of flat steel and grinding away
parts of it to reveal a pattern. Others bend metal into a simple pattern. For
something like a signature, the first approach wouldn&#39;t produce as fine a
result as I would like and the second approach isn&#39;t a real option.</p>

<p>Following <a href="http://www.thefrankes.com/wp/?s=branding+iron">an article</a> on
producing a 3D model of the brand and then buying a print of the part from
<a href="https://www.shapeways.com/">shapeways</a>. In the original article, the part was
US$6, but mine weighed in at US$21.</p>

<p>It&#39;s helpful to be familiar with vector art, and ideally some basic 3D modeling
since this approach involves a scanner and the following free software:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Inkscape</h2>

<p>The process begins with getting a rough scan of a fancy signature. I played around with it on a sheet of paper about a dozen times with a sharpie until I
found one that I liked. Once scanned, Inkscape can <code>Trace Bitmap</code> which
generates a path. It&#39;s pretty noisy, so I simplified the path a couple of times
to smooth it and then deleted all the stray speckles. The remaining control
points needed a little tuning in places to get rid of some sharp points.</p>

<p>The brand will need a backing, so I created a second path that is in the rough
shape of the outside of the design. Export the backing path in one file and the
design itself in another in anticipation of importing them into Blender.</p>

<h2>Blender</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the free version of SketchUp doesn&#39;t allow you to extrude an
arbitrary path, so importing these SVG paths into Blender is so we can take the
flat paths and extrude them into 3D objects.</p>

<p>Extrude the design by 0.625mm (for a total thickness of 1.25mm) and the backing
plate by 1.5mm (for a total thickness of 3mm, the minimum wall thickness for
Shapeways when printing in stainless steel). Offset the backing plate to align
it with the design. <strong>Remember to align it to the appropriate face so that the
text will be in the right orientation when used as a branding iron.</strong></p>

<p>Convert each of these into meshes and <code>join</code> them. Export it as a collada file.</p>

<h2>SketchUp</h2>

<p>The only reason to introduce SketchUp into the mix is so that we can scale the
design to the exact dimensions. <strong>Do not scale the thickness, but only the
height and width.</strong> While you&#39;re here, add a 1/4&quot;-thick rod to the back so that
it can be attached to a handle.</p>

<h2>Shapeways</h2>

<p>Finally, you&#39;re ready to use the model exported from SketchUp to upload it to
Shapeways (or another service) and order a print.</p>

<h2>Mounting and Using</h2>

<p>I ended up boring out a hole in a steel rod and adding a set screw so that I
can mount it. I anticipate making more of these and wanted to have the ability
to interchange them.</p>

<p>For the handle, I turned a roughly palm-sized handle and epoxied the rod into
it. When using it, I heat it up over an open flame and heat it up as evenly as
I can and try it out a few times on a scrap piece of wood of the same species
before applying it to the word piece.</p>
