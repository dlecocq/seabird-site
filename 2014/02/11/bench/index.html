<h2>2x4 Roubo Bench <small>11 Feb 2014</small></h2>

<div class="post">
    <p>For a while now, I had found myself using my tablesaw as a work surface more
than I should. I had a couple of old pieces of OSB that I would lay over it so
that if I needed to use the tablesaw, I could just pick up everything I was
working on using the OSB as a tray. But it was still clear that I needed a
dedicated flat surface.</p>

<p>Recently, I had seen a couple of people talk about building a bench. In
particular, <a href="http://www.stumpynubs.com/2x6-roubo-workbench.html">Stumpy Nubs</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jACdUrQRGjo&amp;list=PLBFh7Sq0DmVqOpX8PGHbnYnA-joe8Nmof">Jord&#39;s Woodshop</a>
had both recently done Roubo builds. I had been turning for about a year, but
I hadn&#39;t done nearly as much non-turning woodworking. Not to mention that a
bench is big and heavy and practically a piece of furniture.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that the Roubo is the only kind of bench. Heck, if the great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJjrB4SvMWg">Norm Abram</a> doesn&#39;t need a
traditional Roubo, then why in the world would I? The reasons I ended up going
that route was because I wanted something heavy, and I think the Roubo style
is beautiful. The more time and energy I put into a tool or a jig, the more
likely I am to use it, and I certainly wanted to make sure I used my bench.</p>

<p>When trying something new, I often begin with the anticipation that I&#39;m going
to have to make it a couple of times before it&#39;s something with which I&#39;m happy.
With that in mind and because I didn&#39;t want to spend too much, I used just
ordinary whitewood studs. At just a couple bucks apiece, it meant I could get
all my lumber for about $50. After I finished, I was reassured when the
<a href="https://drunkenwoodworker.com">drunken woodworker</a> mentioned that he had dont
the same thing -- I wasn&#39;t alone in using a soft wood.</p>

<h1>The Build</h1>

<p>Unfortunately I didn&#39;t take many pictures through the build process, but I began
by squaring up the sides of the boards and then laying them down as they would
eventually be laminated. Without an existing bench, much of this took place on
top of the table saw. With the boards roughly in place, I began to make some
measurements of where the square bench dog holes, round holdfast holes and the
mortises would go in the top. I also decided to put four 3/8&quot; threaded rods
through the benchtop to help clamp it and give it some strength. In hindsight,
I don&#39;t know how much actual strength it gives.</p>

<p>With pieces marked and measured, I drilled all the holdfast holes and the holes
for the threaded rods. The plan was to put the boards on one at a time to help
with any alignment issues in the rods, but it is still pretty important that
they line up well.</p>

<p><img src="/seabird-site/assets/2014/01/bench-glue-up.jpg" alt="Bench rough"></p>

<p>Once drilled, I began laminating the top, only working on the center boards. The
outer three boards on either side had either a mortise, dovetail of bench dog so
I figured it would be best to hold off adding those to the bench until the rest
was glued up. This glue up was lengthy and messy, and the threaded rods
certainly helped here after one of my bar clamps broke.</p>

<p><img src="/seabird-site/assets/2014/01/bench-tenon.jpg" alt="Bench tenon"></p>

<p>I began adding the remaining outside boards once the glue had dried, and then
fit the legs to the top and let those glue up. A few braces between them and
the legs were finished.</p>

<p><img src="/seabird-site/assets/2014/01/bench-flattening.jpg" alt="Bench flattening"></p>

<p>I spent about 6 hours on a Saturday planing the top by hand. When I finally
reached a surface I was reasonably satisfied with, I checked for cupping and
twist and was suddenly discouraged. While most sections were a pleasure to
plane, the occasional knot or endgrain from the legs made the whole experience
much less satisfying. I ended up using a method I remember being described by
<a href="http://www.thewoodwhisperer.com/videos/flattening-workbenches-and-wide-boards-with-a-router/">The Wood Whisperer</a>
involving a cradle for my router and two boards made perfectly parallel to each
other and clamped to the bench. I have to admit that I was quite intimidated by
this approach but the results made it well worth it.</p>

<p><img src="/seabird-site/assets/2014/01/bench-texture.jpg" alt="Bench texture"></p>

<p>The router left a very regular pattern, and I decided it wasn&#39;t what I wanted.
Some light smoothing with a hand plane dealt with most of it. I made myself a
set of sanding blocks in order to sand the top, which went surprisingly quickly.
I didn&#39;t spend much time sanding the legs or the braces between them since I
figured they were less important and I was frankly pretty ready to be done with
the project at this point.</p>

<p><img src="/seabird-site/assets/2014/01/bench-flat.jpg" alt="Bench flattened"></p>

<p>Before putting on a finish, I cut all the legs to the same length now that the
top surface was perfectly flat. I also took this opportunity to trim off the
uneven edges off the top.</p>

<p>I had been a little intimidated by this project, and it was my wife who really
encouraged me to give it a shot. So my last step before finishing it was to
leave a little inscription as a reminder of her support.</p>

<p><img src="/seabird-site/assets/2014/01/bench-inscription.jpg" alt="Erin Believes in Me"></p>

<p>I put a couple coats of sanding sealer on the thing and then a few coats of
polyurethane. I&#39;ve been using it for a about a month now and I don&#39;t know how
I lived before it.</p>

<h1>What I Regret</h1>

<p>I think this project went really well. Much better than I had anticipated it
could. My only real regret is not skip-planing all the 2x4&#39;s before I began
working on it. It turns out that each board has a thickness slightly different
from each other, and it was enough to make things like he mortise and tenon and
sliding dovetail to be kind of a pain.</p>

<p>I love the bench dogs. But do wish I had spent a little more time ensuring they
were uniform size. It&#39;s not a huge problem, but it just means that some are a
little snug and others have more play than I&#39;d like.</p>

<p><img src="/seabird-site/assets/2014/01/bench-dogs.jpg" alt="Bench dogs"></p>

<h1>Examples and Inspiration</h1>

<p>There were a few people&#39;s benched I really looked at before committing to
building my own.</p>

<h2>Stumpy Nubs</h2>

<p>Stumpy, as always, took a very pragmatic approach to the bench. The bench dog
holes and the mortise and sliding dovetail were cut before laminating the
boards, making life much easier. I would say my bench is most heavily inspired
by his. Ultimately I didn&#39;t buy his plans -- not out of an unwillingness to
support his projects, but out of the desire to piece it together myself.</p>

<h2>Jord&#39;s Woodshop</h2>

<p>Jord did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jACdUrQRGjo&amp;list=PLBFh7Sq0DmVqOpX8PGHbnYnA-joe8Nmof">great series</a>
of videos on his latest bench build, which was a pleasure to watch. Had I
access to a large-enough jointer and thickness planer, I would likely have used
more of his techniques. More than anything, what I took out of it was
inspiration and encouragement.</p>

<h2>Norm Abram</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJjrB4SvMWg">Norm makes a bench</a> that is quite
pragmatic and much less snobby than most Roubo builds. It&#39;s definitely
Roubo-inspired, but built out of 2x4&#39;s, plywood and hardboard. I
really don&#39;t care much for the look of it, but it was nice to hear such a good
woodworker take such a pragmatic approach. It even has a shelf and a tool tray.
I like the hardboard because it makes it easy to freshen up the surface if it
eventually gets too dinged up.</p>

<h2>Alex Harris</h2>

<p>Alex has <a href="http://thiswoodwork.com/build-a-cheap-woodworking-workbench">plans</a>
for a bench not dissimilar from Norm&#39;s. It is cheaper and easier than Stumpy&#39;s,
but I wanted a real bench and a bit of a challenge. Though, I was definitely
tempted by the ease of the project.</p>

<h2>Colin Knecht</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GctmBLeSVvc">His workbench</a> is pretty basic
and again in much the same style as Norm. What you must really appreciate about
it though are the unique features. It&#39;s got one corner with two boards attached
at exactly 90 degrees to each other to serve as a reference square for glue-ups
and such. He also keeps a power strip (for turning on and off tools in bulk) and
a light -- gotta love it.</p>

<h2>Amalgamated Ideas</h2>

<p>I collected some of the ideas that I&#39;d been playing around with before building
the bench. Many of these are not mine, and I definitely didn&#39;t implement most
of them though I will revisit some of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shelves. A lot of time, I need to put finish on a lot of little pieces, and
it might be nice to have some drawers that slide in and out so that I have
a bunch of places to work on pieces and let them dry.</li>
<li>Different surfaces. I might even go the route of having a thin board that I
can apply to the top for work that&#39;s maybe a little harder on the bench than
I&#39;d like. For example, some thin hardboard for things dealing with epoxy.</li>
<li>Alex Harris uses dowels as pins in a lot of places, and it might be a nice
little aesthetic touch to use some contrasting wood as an accent.</li>
<li>Bolts in the legs. Alex also uses bolts when attaching the legs, which allows
him to disassemble it if needed. This has occurred to me, but the vote of
confidence in the idea is nice.</li>
<li>Melamine. It might be nice to have a melamine surface for (as Alex points
out) filming against a white background. It would also be nice for cleanup.</li>
<li>Built-in square. Colin Knecht keeps two boards permanently on the top that
are at 90 degrees to one another.</li>
<li>Bench-dog lamp. Colin makes the good point that it&#39;s nice to have extra light
where you&#39;re working, and I thought it might be nice to make an adapter for
those arm lights to fit into the bench dogs.</li>
<li>Power strip on the side. You know, for tools.</li>
<li>Same height as table saw. Because it would be nice to be able to use it as an
outfeed table.</li>
</ul>
