<h2>Earring Tree <small>01 Dec 2013</small></h2>

<div class="post">
    <p>I was recently spending a lot of time preparing for an upcoming craft fair,
including making a lot of turned earrings. I wanted a way to display these
earrings and after scouring Etsy for some inspiration, I decided to make a tree
out of wire with a wooden base and many curly branches from which to hang
earrings.</p>

<p>It would begin with a wooden base that would hold 20 long aluminum wires, and
I wanted all of these wires to be consistently spaced in a circle. I didn&#39;t
trust measuring them out onto the base by hand, and so I ended up making an
indexing plate. After turning the base, I marked a circle lightly in pencil and
then used the indexing plate to make 20 evenly-spaced marks.</p>

<p>With these marks in place, I drilled some pilot holes by hand with a set of
micro drill bits in a pin vise, and then drilled them at a size appropriate for
the gauge of the wires and secured them in place with CA glue. In hindsight, I
would have probably drilled the holes all the way through the base and secured
the wires with epoxy or crimped the ends once through the hole.</p>

<p>In order to twist up all the wires into the trunk, I turned a second piece of
wood similar to the base (all the evenly-spaced holes and all that). In this
piece, the holes need to be large enough to allow the wires to pass through
easily and without any resistance. There also needs to be a large hole in the
center to hold the wires that as they get removed from the trunk to make the
branches.</p>

<p>The twisting of the trunk begins with putting each wire through the
corresponding hole in the winding tool. It can be a little tricky to wind the
trunk evenly, but it gets easier as it progresses. Rather than just removing
pull out wires to form the branches, it&#39;s best to pick a few wires to remove
and place them temporarily in the hole in the middle of the tool, winding the
remaining wires a bit and <em>then</em> pull them out to be branches. This way the
branches can&#39;t simply unwind from the tree if they&#39;re pulled.</p>

<p>With the branches poking out from the main trunk, I found that twisting the
branches into random patterns didn&#39;t work very well. Instead I wrapped each
branch around a dowel repeatedly to form a coil. When all the branches have
been made into coils, I pulled each branch to stretch out the coil revealing
a number of nice and even places to hang ornaments. Fluff as needed.</p>
