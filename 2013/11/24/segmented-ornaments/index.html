<h2>Segmented Tree Ornaments <small>24 Nov 2013</small></h2>

<div class="post">
    <p>Coming off of the successful completion of the snowflake ornaments, I decided
to take on some of my first segmented turning projects. The always great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nu4cHqiBGI">Frank Howarth</a> made a segmented
Christmas ornament with some Christmas-tree shapes embedded in it. Though
beautiful, I thought it was sort of a shame that it took so much wood and
segmented work for a single ornament.</p>

<p>I figured that instead, I could take the completed segments and turn the log
round and then slice it up. In the above video, Frank completed the design in
two halves, but I decided to make each layer of the tree a single piece rather
than two. Once cut, I glued each layer up and then sanded it flat once dried.</p>

<p>When gluing the layers together, Frank mentioned having trouble keeping the
pieces aligned while clamping. In order to solve this, I took an old, snapped
bandsaw blade and glued a couple of pieces of it into some wooden blocks,
allowing the smooth backend of the blade to protrude by about 1/8&quot;. The plan
was then to then cut shallow grooves into the center of each end of each layer
and then allow the bandsaw blade to sit in the groove and keep the layers
aligned. Turns out, it worked great. And important part of this approach, though
is to make sure that each layer is nearly exactly the same length.</p>

<p>With the log all glued up, I mounted it on the lathe and turned it round. The
log turned out to be about 4&quot; in diameter, and more than a little dangerous to
cut on the bandsaw as-is. To make it more stable, I glued a square block of wood
to the end that I was holding to keep it from twisting around.</p>

<p>They took a fair amount of work (mostly the sanding), but in the end I made
about 70 and they came out pretty well. I finished them with a polyurethane, but
in hindsight I should have used some sanding sealer first.</p>
